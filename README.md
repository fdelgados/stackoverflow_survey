# Stack Overflow Survey

Some questions to answer before starting a career as a software developer.

### Installation:

Apart from the libraries installed with the Anaconda distribution, no additional library is needed.
Since GitHub does not allow the upload of files larger than 100 MB, I attach the link to the data:

### Project Motivation:

In this project, I intend to answer some questions about the world of software development that can help novice developers 
make the right decisions at the beginning of their careers. To do that, I use the data contained in the Stack Overflow 
Annual Developer Survey 2019. The questions to answer are:

1. What is the most popular programming language?
2. Does the programming language influence the employment status?
3. Do companies take care of code quality?

The findings and insights from this project can be found [here](https://medium.com/@fdelgados/the-hard-beginnings-of-a-developer-2f34cdb03e2a).

### File Descriptions:
